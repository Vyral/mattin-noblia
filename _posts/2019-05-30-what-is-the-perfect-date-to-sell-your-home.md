A new study from Atom Data Solutions looked at data from over 29 million homes over the last eight years and found the best two days to list your home for sale. Listing your home on these two days can bring you 10% more than its market value. These two days are Friday, June 21 and Friday, June 28. Families start their home search in the next few weeks when kids are out of school, and the better weather gives buyers more opportunity to see homes. There is still time to get your home listed before these opportune days pass you by.
