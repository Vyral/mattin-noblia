When Llya and Maria were in the process of moving here from out of state, it was hard for them to look at all the available houses. They were pleasantly surprised to learn that at MORE Realty, we act as the eyes for our clients, finding them homes that match their wants and needs. Today, hear what \[clients 1 & 2\] had to say about their experience with our team as we helped them to find the home they need. “During the process,” they said, “Mattin was very responsive; whenever we had questions—and we were first-time homebuyers, so we had a lot of questions, to be honest—he helped us to set up all the inspections and connect with the right people.” To see their full testimonial, please watch our latest video.
