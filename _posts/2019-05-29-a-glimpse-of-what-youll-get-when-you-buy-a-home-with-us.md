Last summer, I helped Raymond to buy the very home we’re both standing in front of. After his home buying experience with MORE Realty, Raymond had plenty of kind things to say. “ He’s actually very, very professional, in my opinion,” he said. “Very reliable. Every time I called him \[during the purchase process\], he would always answer the phone or call me in the next five minutes. \[…\] Communication is No. 1 for me, and our team was great for that.” Raymond didn’t even see the house before he’d purchased it; we picked up his wife at the airport and brought her out to the Lake Oswego for a few hours on the weekend. “\[MORE Realty\] was very knowledgeable about the area, and it was a very good experience,” he said. If I can help serve you in your real estate journey, please let me know. I look forward to speaking with you.
