A lot has changed in the Portland Metro area real estate market within the last year.&nbsp;

For one thing, supply has shot up. There was a 5.5% increase of available listings over the last year, and an incredible 20% increase in just the last month. **We haven’t seen inventory growth this significantly since 2010.**

However, as of this April, the number of closed sales dropped 4.5% year over year. The decreased number of sales we’ve observed recently is also reflected in the current average days on market. Right now, homes are spending an average of 53 days on the market before selling here in the Portland Metro area.

**Despite this slowdown, we’re definitely still in a seller’s market.** Those thinking of listing right now will be happy to know that the median sales price for single-family homes has increased by 1.2% since last year, going from $395,000 to $399,600.

There’s also good news for those looking to buy, however, as interest rates are still quite low. Ultimately, our current market is rife with opportunity, whatever your real estate goals may be.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me or my team a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
